To build ScisTree2, simply type "make" from the source code. That is usually all you need!

To test if it works, type:

./scistree triv4-paper-1.txt

If it works properly, it should output something like:

*** SCISTREE ver. 2.2.0.0, October 24, 2024 ***

Called genotypes output to file: ../triv4-paper-1.txt.genos.imp
**** Maximum log-likelihood: -6.27126, number of changed genotypes: 2
Computed log-lielihood from changed genotypes: -6.27126
Constructed single cell phylogeny: (((1,3),(2,4)),5)
Elapsed time = 0 seconds.
